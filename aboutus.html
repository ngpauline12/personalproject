    <h2> The Need</h2>
    <a class="paragraph-text">
<p> We throw out tons of fruit and vegetables each year because it has gone soft, mouldy or is out of date. In the United States, food takes up more space in landfills than anything else. How much food do we waste? About 40 million tons every year. That's like if every person in the United States tossed 650 apples into the garbage.
    <br>
<br>
    What causes food waste? Lack of understanding expiration labels, impulsive food purchases, underutilizing leftovers are just top of the line. 
    <br>
    Moreover, wasting food has irreversible environmental consequences-generating 11% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Happy Fridge is about making reducing food waste easy and fun, inspiriing and empowering everyone to take action against food waste.
